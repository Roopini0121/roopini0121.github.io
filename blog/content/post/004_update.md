Hey there! I know it has been a long time. Things have changed in 2 years. I am no more a student. I am an embryologist now, working in Manipal hospital Bangalore. It has been 6 months since I took up this job and it is excellent. Iâ€™m managing the lab end to end right from documentation, and QA QC to ICSI, and embryo transfer. I hope to write more here about my lab experiences and what I am reading.
