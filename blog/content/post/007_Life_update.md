A lot has happed in the past 2 months of my life. I married the love of my life. I moved to a new country and am a student again!

Working on impactful research has been a longing pursuit since them past 4 years of my life. And I've only kept at it at every step of the way. Looking at where I am now and back at the past 4 years, it all makes sense. 

I am currently a master's student at NYU studying Biomedical Informatics. NYU is one of the top medical schools and they are doing really good research. This is quite a pivot for me, considering im coming from a purely clinical backgroud. Working on a deep learning research while in manipal hospital made me understand the impact artificial intelligence can have in healthcare. I have taken this course because I wanna contribute to the super cool innovations happening in healthtech. 

Looking forward to an exciting year!
